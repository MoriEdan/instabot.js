⚠️ *__The project is under early development, many bugs and architect changes are expected.__*

We are working on an experimental development which is an attempt
to recreate instabot as a pluggable desktop application with a simple and friendly ui.

## Contribute

The project uses the Node.js version compatible with the latest used in [electron](https://electronjs.org/).
The current version can be found in the `.nvmrc`. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for version management.

We respect code quality and tests. Therefore, each package has `lint` and `test` npm scripts which runs code validation and testing commands.

Also we are glad to see any suggestions and ideas, you can write them in issues.
